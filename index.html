              <ul>
                  <li>A 401(k) plan is a company-sponsored retirement account that employees can contribute to. Employers may also make matching contributions.
                  <li>There are two basic types of 401(k)s—traditional and Roth—which differ primarily in how they're taxed. In a traditional 401(k), employee contributions are "pre-tax." That is, the money is deducted from gross income and no taxes are due on it until the money is withdrawn. With a Roth, employees pay the income taxes up front but can make withdrawals tax-free.</li>
                  <li>For 2020, under the CARES Act, the withdrawal rules were relaxed for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and RMDs were suspended.</li>

          <h2>Roth</h2>
          <p class="iraScript">an individual retirement account allowing a person to set aside after-tax income up to a specified amount each year. Both earnings on the account and withdrawals after age 59½ are tax-free.</p>

          <h2>Simple</h2>
          <p class="iraScript">A SIMPLE IRA is a retirement savings plan that most small businesses with 100 or fewer employees can use. "SIMPLE" stands for "Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees," and "IRA" stands for "Individual Retirement Account." Employers can choose to make a non-elective contribution of 2% of the employee's salary or a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of the employee's contributions to the plan up to 3% of their salary.</p>
